Hey there 👋
I'm Hassene Ghariani, a 3rd-year Software Engineering student from Sfax, Tunisia.

I mostly work on Java web applications and mobile development, building things that solve real problems.

This is a fresh profile where I'll be uploading some smaller projects, experiments, and things I'm currently working on.
